You are given an existing single-page app stored in **`input.html`**, which implements a drag-and-drop note organizer using jQuery UI portlets.
Your task is to generate **two new files**:

1. **`enhanced.html`** — a standalone enhanced version of the app
2. **`README.md`** — documentation describing the enhancements and how to use the updated app

**Do NOT modify `input.html`.**
Your solution must produce a new HTML file that preserves all existing behaviors while adding the improvements below.

In addition, you will be given a **JSON layout file**, and your output must demonstrate that the enhanced app can correctly import this JSON by presenting the **post-import layout**.

---

# **1. Existing Behavior (for context)**

`input.html` currently:

* Displays multiple `.column` containers.
* Contains draggable portlets (`jQuery UI sortable`).
* Each portlet has a header and content area.
* The header icon collapses/expands the content.

All of this must remain functional in the enhanced version.

---

# **2. Required Feature Improvements**

Your new file **`enhanced.html`** must implement:

---

## **2.1 Add & Delete Notes**

* UI to add new portlets to a chosen column.
* New portlets must be draggable, editable, and include a delete (“✕”) button.

---

## **2.2 Scrollable Long Notes**

* `.portlet-content` must support longer text via fixed/max height + `overflow: auto`.

---

## **2.3 Import & Export as JSON**

Provide UI to:

* **Export** the full layout (columns → ordered portlets → header, content, label).
* **Import** a saved JSON file and rebuild the layout with all behaviors preserved.

**New Requirement:**
You will be given a JSON file eaxmple-layout.json.
Your final response must show **the correct imported layout** based on that JSON, proving that the implementation can parse and render it.

---

## **2.4 Visual Appearance Upgrade**

Improve the UI with:

* better spacing and alignment
* improved colors/backgrounds
* nicer borders, rounding, shadows
* clearer typography
* improved hover/drag cues
* consistent column spacing

---

## **2.5 Note Labels / Color Coding**

* Allow assigning a label/color per note.
* Labels must change note appearance and be included in import/export JSON.

---

## **2.6 Search / Filter Notes**

* Add a search bar that filters notes in real time by header/content.

---

## **2.7 Undo Last Delete**

* Support undoing the most recently deleted note.

---

# **3. Output Requirements**

Your final answer must include both the enhanced HTML and a README.

---

## **3.1 `enhanced.html`**

A complete, runnable HTML page that:

* Implements all features (2.1–2.7)
* Fully preserves existing sortable + toggle behaviors
* Uses inline `<style>` + `<script>`
* Uses only jQuery + jQuery UI
* Runs directly in a browser
* Does **not** modify `input.html`
* **Successfully loads the provided JSON and presents the imported layout as the initial visible state**

---

## **3.2 `README.md`**

Must explain:

* Overview of added features
* How to use:

  * add/delete
  * labels/colors
  * search/filter
  * import/export
  * undo delete
  * scrollable content
  * drag-and-drop
* Technical notes and styling changes
* File explanation:

  * `input.html` unchanged
  * `enhanced.html` is the new enhanced app

---

# **4. Constraints**

* Output exactly **two** files: `enhanced.html` and `README.md`
* No external frameworks or build steps
* Must run in any modern browser
* Must not modify `input.html`
* The output HTML must **start in a state that reflects the imported JSON layout**

---

# **5. Final Deliverables**

1. **`enhanced.html`** — with imported JSON applied
2. **`README.md`**
