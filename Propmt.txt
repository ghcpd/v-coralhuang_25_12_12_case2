You are given an existing single-page app in a file called **`input.html`**.
This file contains a browser-based drag-and-drop note organizer built using jQuery UI portlets.
The current app works for short notes and basic organization.

Your task is to **produce a new enhanced HTML file** that implements additional features and improves the visual design.
**You must not modify `input.html` directly.**
Instead, you must output a **new, complete HTML file** that incorporates all required improvements while preserving the app’s existing behavior.

---

# **1. Current behavior (for context)**

The app in `input.html` currently:

* Renders multiple columns (`.column`), each containing draggable “portlet” boxes.
* Each portlet has:

  * a header (`.portlet-header`) used as a drag handle,
  * a content block (`.portlet-content`) displaying a brief note.
* Users can drag portlets between columns.
* Clicking the toggle icon in the header collapses/expands the content.

This behavior must continue to work after the enhancement.

---

# **2. Required feature improvements**

Your enhanced output HTML must implement the following new capabilities **and improve overall appearance**.

---

## **2.1 Add and delete notes**

Add UI controls that allow the user to:

* **Create new portlets** inside a selected column.
* New portlets must:

  * be draggable,
  * have editable header + editable content,
  * include a **delete (“✕”) button** in the header.
* Added portlets must follow the improved, modernized styling.

---

## **2.2 Scrollable long notes**

The content area must support longer text:

* Limit content height using CSS.
* Use `overflow: auto` to allow scrolling inside the note.
* Ensure the grid layout remains stable even with long content.

---

## **2.3 JSON export and import**

Add UI elements to support:

### **Export**

* Export the entire layout to JSON (columns + ordered portlets + header + content).
* Allow the user to choose the filename.
* Download the JSON as a file.

### **Import**

* Load a JSON file created by the export function.
* Replace the current layout with the imported one.
* Restored portlets must preserve all styling, interactions, and user-editability.

This feature enables users to maintain multiple “groups” of notes.

---

## **2.4 Visual appearance enhancement (required)**

The enhanced UI must be noticeably more visually appealing, including:

* More modern spacing, padding, and alignment.
* Subtle visual backgrounds or color palette improvements.
* Cleaner borders, consistent rounding, light shadows.
* Improved typography (font size, readability, spacing).
* Better visual cues for dragging or hovering.
* Consistent sizing and spacing across columns and portlets.

You **may override or extend existing CSS**, but must not break sortable/collapse behavior.

---

## **2.5 Preserve all existing functionality**

Even after enhancements, the following must continue working:

* jQuery UI sortable (drag-and-drop between columns).
* Collapse/expand via the toggle icon.
* Basic layout and behavior in `input.html`.

---

# **3. Constraints and expectations**

* All code must remain in a **single new HTML file** that you output.
* Your output **must not modify `input.html` in place**—produce a new standalone enhanced HTML.
* Use only jQuery + jQuery UI (already included in the original).
* Refactor JavaScript where appropriate, but stay inside the same HTML file.
* The output file must run directly in a browser without any build tools.

---

# **4. Final expected output**

Your final answer must be a **fully functional enhanced HTML file** that includes:

* All required new features
* All aesthetic improvements
* Fully working drag/drop and collapse/expand
* Clean, modern UI design
