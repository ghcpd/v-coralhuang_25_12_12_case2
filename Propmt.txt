You are given an existing single-page app stored in **`input.html`**, which implements a drag-and-drop note organizer using jQuery UI portlets.
Your job is to **create two new files**:

1. **`enhanced.html`** — a new standalone enhanced version of the app
2. **`README.md`** — documentation explaining the enhancements and how to use the updated app

**Important:**
Do **not** modify `input.html`.
Your solution must be a **new** HTML file that preserves existing functionality while adding the required improvements.

---

# **1. Existing Behavior (for context)**

`input.html` currently:

* Displays multiple `.column` containers.
* Contains draggable “portlet” boxes (`jQuery UI sortable`).
* Each portlet has:

  * a draggable header (`.portlet-header`),
  * a content area (`.portlet-content`).
* The header icon toggles content visibility.

Your enhanced version must keep all of this intact.

---

# **2. Required Feature Improvements**

Your new file `enhanced.html` must implement:

---

## **2.1 Add & Delete Notes**

* Provide UI to add a new portlet to a chosen column.
* New portlets must:

  * be draggable,
  * allow editing header and content,
  * include a delete (“✕”) button.
* They must follow improved styling.

---

## **2.2 Scrollable Long Notes**

* `.portlet-content` must support longer text via:

  * fixed/max height,
  * `overflow: auto`.

---

## **2.3 Import & Export JSON**

Add UI to:

### **Export**

* Serialize the entire layout (columns + ordered portlets + header + content).
* Allow user-specified filename.
* Download as JSON.

### **Import**

* Load JSON saved earlier.
* Rebuild the full layout.
* Restored portlets must retain behaviors and styling.

---

## **2.4 Visual Appearance Upgrade**

Improve overall aesthetics, including:

* cleaner spacing, padding, alignment
* improved colors or backgrounds
* rounded corners, shadows, nicer borders
* more readable typography
* better hover / drag-handle feedback
* consistent column spacing

CSS may be extended or overridden but must not break sortable or toggle behavior.

---

# **3. Output Requirements**

Your final answer must include:

---

## **3.1 `enhanced.html`**

A complete, runnable HTML page that:

* Implements all new features
* Preserves drag-and-drop + collapse/expand
* Contains inline `<style>` and `<script>`
* Uses only jQuery + jQuery UI
* Runs directly in a browser
* Does **not** overwrite or modify `input.html`

---

## **3.2 `README.md`**

Must explain:

### **Overview**

* What the enhanced version adds
* Summary of major improvements

### **Usage**

* How to add / delete notes
* How JSON import/export works
* How scrollable content behaves
* How to drag & rearrange portlets

### **Technical Notes**

* Main code changes
* Styling changes
* Dependencies

### **File Information**

* `input.html` remains unchanged
* `enhanced.html` is the new app

---

# **4. Constraints**

* Produce exactly two files: `enhanced.html` and `README.md`
* No external frameworks or build tools
* Must be runnable in a modern browser
* Must not modify `input.html`

---

# **5. Final Deliverables**

Your response must include:

1. **`enhanced.html`** — the enhanced app
2. **`README.md`** — clear documentation
