You are given an existing single-page app that runs in the browser and uses drag-and-drop “portlet” text boxes arranged in columns. It currently works for short notes and basic organization, using jQuery UI’s sortable behavior.

Your goal is to implement **feature improvements** on top of the existing behavior, **and improve the overall visual appearance of the interface**, without breaking the current drag-and-drop and collapse/expand functionality.

You will receive the current implementation in a separate HTML file.

---

### Current behavior (for context)

* The page renders several columns (`.column`), each containing draggable “portlet” boxes.
* Each portlet has:

  * a header (`.portlet-header`) used as the drag handle;
  * a content area (`.portlet-content`) that displays a short text note.
* The user can drag portlets between columns.
* Clicking the icon in the header collapses/expands the content area.

---

## **Required feature improvements**

Update the existing HTML/JavaScript so that the app supports the following features and **looks cleaner, more polished, and visually consistent**:

---

### **1. Add and delete notes**

* Provide UI controls to **add a new portlet** to a selected column.
* New portlets must:

  * be draggable like existing ones,
  * have editable header and content,
  * include a **delete (“✕”) button** in the header.
* Added portlets must visually match the improved styling requirements.

---

### **2. Scrollable long note content**

* The content region must support long text input:

  * Use a fixed/max height for content areas.
  * Make long content scrollable (`overflow: auto`).
* Ensure scrollbars and spacing are visually clean and do not break column layout.

---

### **3. JSON export and import of layouts**

Provide UI for:

* **Exporting** the layout as a JSON file (including columns, order, headers, and content).

  * Let the user choose a filename.
  * The JSON should accurately represent all portlets.

* **Importing** a previously saved JSON file.

  * Clear the current layout and rebuild all portlets from JSON input.
  * Imported portlets must retain the improved visual styles and interactions.

This feature allows users to switch between different saved “groups” of notes.

---

### **4. Improve visual appearance (required aesthetic enhancement)**

In addition to functional updates, **the UI must be made more visually appealing**, including but not limited to:

* Enhanced spacing, padding, and alignment.
* Modernized color palette or subtle backgrounds.
* More polished borders, shadows, or rounded corners.
* More readable typography (font size, line-height, etc.).
* Improved column spacing and portlet layout consistency.
* Better visual feedback on hover, drag handle, or selected states.

You **may extend or override styles**, but do not remove essential jQuery UI classes unless replaced cleanly.

The interface should feel cleaner, more modern, and more visually coherent.

---

### **5. Preserve existing behavior**

* jQuery UI sortable must continue working.
* Collapsing/expanding via the header icon must remain functional.
* The underlying structure may be refactored, but base interactions must remain intact.

---

## **Constraints and expectations**

* All code must remain inside a **single HTML file** (`<style>` + `<script>` allowed).
* Use only jQuery + jQuery UI (already included); do not add frameworks.
* JavaScript may be refactored into helper functions for maintainability.
* The resulting file must run directly in a modern browser with no build steps.

Your output should be the **updated HTML file** containing:

* All required new features
* All aesthetic improvements
* Fully working drag/drop and collapse/expand
* Clean, visually enhanced UI
