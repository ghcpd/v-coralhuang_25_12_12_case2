You are given an existing single-page app stored in **`input.html`**, which implements a drag-and-drop note organizer using jQuery UI portlets.
Your job is to generate **two new files**:

1. **`enhanced.html`** — a standalone enhanced version of the app
2. **`README.md`** — documentation describing the enhancements and how to use the updated app

**Do NOT modify `input.html`.**
Your solution must be a new HTML file that keeps all existing behaviors while adding the improvements below.

---

# **1. Existing Behavior (for context)**

`input.html` currently:

* Shows multiple `.column` containers.
* Contains draggable portlets (`jQuery UI sortable`).
* Each portlet has a header (drag handle) and content area.
* The header icon toggles content visibility.

These behaviors must remain functional.

---

# **2. Required Feature Improvements**

Your new file **`enhanced.html`** must implement:

---

## **2.1 Add & Delete Notes**

* UI to add new portlets to a chosen column.
* New portlets must be draggable, editable (header + content), and include a delete (“✕”) button.

---

## **2.2 Scrollable Long Notes**

* Make `.portlet-content` support long text via a fixed/max height and `overflow: auto`.

---

## **2.3 Import & Export as JSON**

Provide UI to:

* **Export** the entire layout (columns + ordered portlets + header + content + label).
* **Import** a saved JSON file and rebuild the layout, preserving all interactions.

---

## **2.4 Visual Appearance Upgrade**

Improve the UI so it looks modern and polished, including:

* better spacing and alignment
* updated colors/backgrounds
* improved borders, shadows, rounding
* clearer typography
* hover / drag feedback
* consistent column spacing

---

## **2.5 Note Labels / Color Coding**

* Allow assigning a label/color to each note (e.g., “Default”, “Important”, “Idea”).
* Labels must visually change the note and be included in import/export JSON.

---

## **2.6 Search / Filter Notes**

* Add a search bar that filters notes in real time by header or content text.

---

## **2.7 Undo Last Delete**

* Support undoing the most recently deleted note (restore data and interactions).

---

# **3. Output Requirements**

---

## **3.1 `enhanced.html`**

A complete HTML document that:

* Implements all features (2.1–2.7)
* Preserves drag-and-drop and collapse/expand behavior
* Uses inline `<style>` and `<script>`
* Uses only jQuery + jQuery UI
* Runs directly in a browser
* Does **not** modify `input.html`

---

## **3.2 `README.md`**

Must explain:

* Overview of new features

* How to use:

  * add/delete notes
  * labels/color coding
  * search/filter
  * import/export
  * scrollable notes
  * drag-and-drop
  * undo delete

* Technical notes, styling changes, dependencies

* Clarify that:

  * `input.html` is unchanged
  * `enhanced.html` is the new enhanced app

---

# **4. Constraints**

* Output exactly **two** files: `enhanced.html` and `README.md`
* No external frameworks or build steps
* Must run in any modern browser
* Must not modify `input.html`

---

# **5. Final Deliverables**

1. **`enhanced.html`**
2. **`README.md`**
